# ruksads-token

This repository contains a sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's also a great fit for learning the basics of
smart contract development.

```sh
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd dapp
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.
